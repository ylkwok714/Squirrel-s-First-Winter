Dark Academia Custom GUI instructions:

This file includes the TTF file for the font Forum but you can download it here: 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Forum?preview.text_type=custom&query=forum

You can credit me as Jaime Scribbles, but it isn't required.

Made for and Coded in Ren'py version 7.4.4.1439

Instructions:
1. Unzip the file and place 'Custom GUI 3' into your directory where you keep your Ren'py games.
2. Rename the game to your game title!
	* There are 3 places in options.rpy where the name needs changed: config.name, build.name, and 	save_directory (only change CustomGUI3 in save_directory, not the dash or numbers.)
3. Create your game the same way you would normally!

****
Achievements, Endings, and Gallery have code located under custom_gui_variables_and_code.rpy

You can list your achievements, endings and gallery using the sample code provided.

in your script use the persistent variables to unlock the items like this:
$ persistent.cg_1_unlocked = True

Helpful Ren'py resources!
